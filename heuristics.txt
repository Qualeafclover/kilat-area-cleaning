General idea

Looking at the accumulated merit points, assign tasks to people who have the least points
Toilet merit points are valued higher, as in the algorithm will try and balance out the toilet IC role the most
Though unlikely, the algorithm will try not to assign toilet ICs to the same recruit multiple times in a row
If there are multiple people with the same merit points, the roles will be assigned randomly
Random assignment is done with a seed that is relative to the day the cleaning session is held
